# Ray-Based Modeling of Gravitational Fields

This project explores a novel framework for modeling gravitational fields using a ray-based approach. The field at an observation point is defined as the aggregation of line-integrated mass contributions along all incoming directions. This approach is consistent with classical Newtonian gravity in the static case and shows potential for extension to relativistic scenarios.

## Disclaimer

I am fully aware that this topic often attracts cranks. Although I has some mathematical background (BSc), I lack advanced training in physics and do not belong to the academic community. These factors understandably raise several red flags. Nevertheless, I have made a sincere effort to approach the concept with honesty and intellectual rigor.

I have attempted to submit the document to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) (under the `physics.class-ph` category), but this has not been possible due to the lack of an endorser. If you are registered as an endorser and believe the document has some academic interest, I would be grateful if you could [endorse me](https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=JMPHZQ).
