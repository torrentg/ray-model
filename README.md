# Ray-Based Modeling of Gravitational Fields

A novel framework for modeling gravitational fields is developed using a ray-based approach. At any observation point, the field is defined as the direction-weighted aggregation of line-integrated mass contributions along all incoming directions. In the static case, the formulation reproduces the classical Newtonian gravitational field and shows potential to replicate also relativistic scenarios. The approach represents an initial step in ray-based gravitational modeling, open to further refinement and generalization.

## Disclaimer

This work is not a substitute for established gravitational theory and should be read as a speculative modeling approach intended to invite scrutiny and constructive feedback. While I have formal undergraduate training in mathematics, the material has not undergone peer review. Assumptions and derivations are stated explicitly; any errors are my responsibility and critical evaluation is welcome.

If you are an [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) endorser and consider this work of potential academic interest, an [endorsement](https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=JMPHZQ) to facilitate submission would be appreciated.
